Subject:   random number generators

When I posted the code for George Marsaglia's universal random number 
generator, I forgot to mention that the seed variables can only have 
certain values:

i, j, and k  must be between 1 and 178 (not all of them 1)
l must be in the range 0 to 168

I am posting a slightly modified version of the code that requires only two
seed variables which basically have the range 0 to 30000. One nice feature 
of this version is that each subsequence of numbers specified by the two 
seeds has a length of approximately 10^30. If different parts of a large 
calculation is being worked on by several people, each person could be 
given his own IJ seed. That would leave 30000 more seeds for the individual 
to use -- without fear that any part of the overall calculation would 
experience correlations in the random numbers. 

Finally, it should also be noted that to save the state of the random number 
generator at any point in time, you have to save the entire contents of the
common block

C This random number generator originally appeared in "Toward a Universal 
C Random Number Generator" by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman. 
C Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)
C 
C It was later modified by F. James and published in "A Review of Pseudo-
C random Number Generators" 
C 
C THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
C       (However, a newly discovered technique can yield 
C         a period of 10^600. But that is still in the development stage.)
C
C It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period 
C   of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all 
C   machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point 
C   representation). 
C 
C The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
C   and 33, and operation "subtraction plus one, modulo one") and an 
C   "arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).
C
C On a Vax 11/780, this random number generator can produce a number in 
C    13 microseconds.
